The SWC Flooring Application has two modes. 

In Training mode, the user will be able to train on the application by creating
orders, but cannot save orders. In Production mode, the user will be able to save
and process all orders.

To change, please set mode in configurationFile.txt to either "TRN" or "PRD"

Training Mode = TRN
Production Mode = PRD
